- Express it as a model
- Map the model to a plan that is 1:1 with phx.live.gen
- Plan for less than 40 hours of work
	- Prioritize

### Filosofi
- Generator first, code second
- Generated code is the canonical representation of your app
- Generated code is complete, don't remove parts
- Don't change context module, make a module for commands
- Run mix test.watch < 5s
- Use liveview for everything
- phx.gen.auth
- Use component framework like petal.build or daisyui
